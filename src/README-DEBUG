To run sniffdet for debug purposes, you have to avoid dropping root (to
get coredump files) and must specify a valid config file name and a
plugindir if you didn't installed it yet:

./sniffdet -g 0 -u 0 --configfile=../sniffdet.conf \
	--pluginsdir=./plugins/ -t TEST(s) TARGET

Of course, remember to compile it with debug activated (pass
--enable-debug to configure)
