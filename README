 Sniffdet is an OpenSource implementation of a set of tests
 for remote sniffers detection in TCP/IP network environments.
 It is useful for remote sniffer detection or to just discover
 machines which are running in promiscuous mode.


BUILDING
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    (If you've downloaded it from SVN, run "autoreconf -ifs" to generate
    build files before running the commands below)

    ./configure
    make

    Requirements
        - Standard compilation tools (gcc, make, etc)
        - libnet 1.0 - http://www.packetfactory.net/projects/libnet/
          Please note that libnet 1.1 is not compatible with libnet 1.0
          and so it won't work.
        - libpcap - http://www.tcpdump.org/

    Note for FreeBSD users:
        - This program is not well tested on *BSD systems. In order to
          compile it, you may need some libraries (like GNUgetopt for
          getopt_long()) not available on BSD by default

        - Patches and bug reports with portability issues are really
          welcome.  :-)
