The big TODO is to port sniffdet to libnet-1.1. Whoever does that is going
to receive a lot of karma points. :-)

Application
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Be more interactive
    - Allow multiple network interfaces to be used (in a per-tests basis)
    - Improve target's file (allow ranges of IPs to be used)
    - Config file parser is sort of brain-damaged. :-)
    - Config file new options (add parser for payload, for example).
      Specially the options for the latency test.
    - The options for the latency_test must be passed in bogus_pkt, which
      must be filled entirely by the application.
    - Improve output plugins interface


Library
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - The callback should be called more times by the tests.
    - init_device() should be changed to something more generic...  like
      init(). We need a raw socket to some operations, and having one open
      for every interface doesn't sound like a good idea.
    - Add more debug code and verbose code
    - Add variation of every test (like multiple hosts tests)


Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Improve how-it-works document (in english)
    - Translate images used in our pt_BR paper to english
    - Improve libsniffdet manpage with a better description about every
      function
