<h1>SniffDet - Remote Sniffer Detection Tool/Library</h1>
<h2>Frequently Asqued Questions - FAQ</h2>
<p>
Updated: 2002Dec11
</p>

<h3>What's a sniffer?</h3>
<p>
Tipically, any program that runs collecting data from the network over
an interface is, potentially, a sniffer.</p>
<p>
Harmless examples of it are tcpdump and other diagnostic tools being used by
a network administrator and not so harmless examples can be widely
found in the Internet.</p>
<p>
A sniffer is usually a passive interactor, which means it tries to
inject packets in the network as less as possible. This characteristic
makes it difficult to find it and it's the great reason we have
so few tools to perform this task although the great demand for them.
</p>

<h3>What's sniffdet?</h3>
<p>
Sniffdet is an OpenSource implementation of a set of tests for
remote sniffers detection in TCP/IP network environments. The
project itself is composed of flexible and easy to
use library and an application to run the tests.
</p>

<h3>How can I help?</h3>
<p>
You can join the sniffdet mailing list by sending an empty message to 
<a href="mailto:sniffdet-devel-request@lists.sourceforge.net">
<i>sniffdet-devel-request@lists.sourceforge.net</i></a> with
<i>subscribe</i> as the subject.
</p>
<p>
Or if you prefer, you can join using the mailman interface from
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sniffdet-devel">
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sniffdet-devel</a>.
</p>
<p>
Basically, any help is welcome. But there are some subjects where
it's <b>more than welcome</b> :)
<ul>
<li>Port to more plataforms</li>
<li>New tests for detections</li>
<li>Graphical application to run the tests (sniffdet GUI)</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can also browse and report <b>BUGS</b> using the interface from
sourceforge
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=55730&amp;atid=478046">
<b>here</b></a>.

<h3>Can I detect sniffers in switched networks?</h3>
Yes and no. There are some techniques to detect sniffers in switched
networks. But they're not effective as the ones for shared networks. We
have plans to implement every possible test (even if it's not very
effective) in libsniffdet in the near future.

<h3>Can I detect sniffers in wireless networks?</h3>
<p>
Not yet. We have plans to study and implement every possible test but
we had no hardware or oportunity to study it until now. Any help in
this area (wireless networks) is very appreciated.
</p>

<h3>Can I use sniffdet to test hosts not in my local network?</h3>
<p>
Not yet. There are some kinds of "tests" that <b>try</b> to detect
sniffers in not connected networks (as in switched networks). We are
studiyng this area and have plans to develop and implement this kind of
tests too.
