autoconf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - use config.h to pass definitons to source files instead of using
      -D in gcc. We also need configure to handle PLUGINSDIR and other
      variables (like SNDET_DEFAULT_{UID,GID} in a better way.

    - it must stop when something mandatory is not found, like some
      header. Optionally, we can use values from config.h to supply
      alternatives. (partially implemented)

    - We need to compile cleanly in FreeBSD and other OSes (Where we don't
      have getopt_long for example). We could add an internal module to be
      used in that situations (I added a getopt module to our "external"
      repository).


Application
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Maybe use ncurses to implement a better interface (with callback,
      results, warnings and so in different windows) or just cleanup the
      current callback/log interface.

    - Call log more times (?)

    - Allow multiple network interfaces to be used (in a per tests basis)

    - Improve target's file (allow ranges of IPs to be used)

    - Config file new options (add parser for payload, for example).
      Specially the options for the latency test.

    - The options for the latency_test must be passed in bogus_pkt, which
      must be fill entirely the the application.

    - Improve output plugins interface


Library
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Build shared library (use libtool)

    - callback should be called more times by the tests

    - init_device() should be changed to something more generic...  like
      init(). We need a raw socket to some operations, and having one
      open for every interface doesn't sound like a good idea.

    - Add more debug code and verbose code

    - Add variation of every test (like multiple hosts tests)


Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Write HowItWorks document (in english)

    - Translate images used in our pt_BR paper

    - Improve libsniffdet manpage with better description about every
      function
