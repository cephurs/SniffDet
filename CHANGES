sniffdet 0.10
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a bugfix release, intended to fix compilation problems on modern
Linux distributions. The project has been offline for a long time, but
it has not been forgotten. :-)

- new build-system, using state-of-the-art autootols techniques and
  compiling with latest linux distributions :-)
- patch from Andrew Lockhart <andrew [ at ] ingsoc.net>, fixing get_mac()
  which was totally b0rken
- General code cleanup

sniffdet 0.9
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2003 Jul 04
- Fixed test cancelation using the callback (it was not working in many cases).
- Fixed test status report to the callback.
- Created '/doc' directory. By now, this directory will contain
  only technical documentation (in english).
- Added libsniffdet-usage-example.c to /doc (guess what is it) :)
- Fixed segfault when using a targets file.
- Fixed tmout and tries default values in icmp, dns and arp
  tests.
- Changes in snprintf() calls to avoid format string bugs -
  scan_args(), exploitable only if sniffdet is suid (not standard,
  strongly not recommended).
- sndet_random() is now more robust.
- Fixed issue #645769 (arp test validity could be checked).
  Actually, I'm not just checking the validity, but eliminating
  the false positives possibility that existed before. :)
- Added RCS tags to all .{c,h} files

sniffdet 0.8
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Minor code cleanups and interface cosmetic changes
- Fixed bug #645773 (cmdline args and conf_file options mixed)
  The approach I took is a little nasty IMHO (I call scan_args() twice), but
  it works... :-)
- -p/--plugin was not working... fixed.
- Renamed plugins/plugin.h to plugins/plugins.h
- Added a new section to configuration file: plugins{}, with an
  option to set the filename for the xml plugin. In order to do that, I
  changed the plugins API to accept the config structure as one of the
  parameters.
- Fixed bug #662856 (Segmentation fault with CIDR notation
  addresses), reported by Janis Putrams:
  sniffdet was getting sig11 when supplied with a bogus hostname target
  (or something it doesn't understand, like a CIDR network address). The
  problem was in two places: 1) the tests were returning with error without
  setting the info structure. 2) the tests were not returning in all errors,
  specially the latency_test.
- Added sniffdet.conf-debug, with configuration options for debug
  purposes
- Implemented parser for tcp_flags option in latency_test.
- Parallel make doesn't work for sniffdet, so removing it from
  RPM specfile.

sniffdet 0.7 (first public release)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2002 Nov 29
- Adding HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H test to configure (it's used to detect OS version,
  among other things).
- Changing latency test default hw address to one which will pass the kernel
  stack as a multicast/broadcast address when in promiscuous mode (0xff,
  0x...)
- Fixing old calls for sleep() (it should be sndet_sleep())
- Moving BUGS file from sndet/src/libs to sndet/ dir and adding some bug
  entries there (and also cleaning TODO file)

2002 Nov 26
- log and callback improvements
- New option: --silent (no output during program execution)
- Added "logtype" entry to configfile (now you can direct log output to one
  or a combination of FILE, SYSLOG, STDERR, STDOUT

- using config.h for some variables now (still needs improvements)

2002 Nov 25
- manpage changes (cleanups, cosmetic)
- DEBUG disabled by default (configure)
- Minor cleanups

2002 Nov 22

  lost)

  The function now checks the pkt_len and returns false (0)

  PCAP_FILTER_BUFF_SIZE is ok, there are other variables though.
