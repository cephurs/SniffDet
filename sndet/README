 Sniffdet is an OpenSource implementation of a set of tests
 for remote sniffers detection in TCP/IP network environments.
 It is useful for remote sniffer detection or to just discover
 machines which are running in promiscuous mode.


BUILDING
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    ./configure
    make

    Requirements
        - Standard compilation tools (gcc, make, etc)
        - libnet 1.0 - http://www.packetfactory.net/projects/libnet/
          Please note that libnet 1.1 is not compatible with libnet 1.0
          and so it won't work.
        - libpcap - http://www.tcpdump.org/

Note for FreeBSD users:
    - This program is not well tested on *BSD systems. In order to
      compile it, you may need some libraries (like GNUgetopt for
      getopt_long()) not available on BSD by default

    - Patches and bug reports with portability issues are really
      welcome. :-)
